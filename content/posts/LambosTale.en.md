## Introduction

This project, realized with a team of 11 people mixing programmers, game designers and game artists, represents our third year final project.
It is a bit special as it was a 100% remote project (due to Covid-19), and most of the team members had never met before.

**Lambo's Tale** is a Metroidvania game in which we play as Lambo, a little lamb who's trying to take revenge on the wolf gang which bullied his little sister.
