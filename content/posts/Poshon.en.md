## Introduction

This project was a R&D project on Nintendo Switch.
Our objective was to explore the functionalities of this console by creating a local multiplayer party-game.
Poshon (ポーション) is a local multiplayer party-game in which players have to reproduce potions as accurately as possible within a given amount of time.
Potion attributes can be changed by interacting with the environment and completing mini-games.
