**Postbird in Provence** is my graduation project at Isart Digital. It's a cute adventure game that was initially developed for Nintendo Switch, making use of most of the features the joycons have to offer (HD haptics, gyroscope, accelerometer...). It was a nice technical challenge to try to reach 60 FPS on the platform.
