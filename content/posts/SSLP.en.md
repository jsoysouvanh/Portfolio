## Introduction

This project was about working on procedural generation of 2D terrain. Slide Slide Little Penguin looks like the game "Tiny Wings", but the game's goal is a bit different: the player has to make his/her penguin go as far as possible in 30 seconds. Best scores are saved and displayed on the title screen.

Making this game brought some challenges on the table. The first one was, of course, the mathematics challenge for the terrain procedural generation. Mobile performances were also to take into account (there is a custom physic system to avoid using Unity's one, which is too heavy for what we were looking for).

## Personal implication

I mostly worked on the mathematics and physics part. The idea was to transform known curves to make sure they can fit in a rectangle with random dimensions, and assert extremum tangents were horizontal (i.e. curve slope is 0) so that the terrain can be continuous and smooth.
If we look at the image above, we can see in the editor view (upper viewport) some randomly generated rectangles. Green rectangles represent ascending curves, while red rectangles represent descending curves. Each kind of curve required some work to resolve equations first, and then was implemented in the game (sinusoidal, polynomial of degree 3, ellptic arc, hyperbolic tangent).
The custom physics system was about having a smooth slide feeling so calculations are not real physics at all.

This project was my first time working on a mobile project, it was cool and fun to make, and I think the game is quite good for the given time.
