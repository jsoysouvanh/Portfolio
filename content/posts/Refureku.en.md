[Refureku](https://github.com/jsoysouvanh/Refureku) is a C++17 dynamic reflection library I wrote as a personnal project in my free time. The github repository has a (hopefully nice) README highlighting the library main functionalities, as well as a [full wiki](https://github.com/jsoysouvanh/Refureku/wiki) going into more details. There's not much to write here, just check the repository out ;)
